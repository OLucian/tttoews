# Tic Tac Toe with WebSockets

Fast written version :)
I had to do this on a Windows machine. Hope no weird stuff.
Please excuse the lack of eslint and the 4 space default vscode tabs and probably many others ( like Redux, React Router, PropTypes :) ), time was short.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Maybe some global npm stuff.

### Installing

Did not make a config env file :(

Default ports
```
front: 3000
server: 8080
```

Front

```
cd app
yarn install
yarn start
```

Server

```
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Running the tests

I will need more time for tests :(

## Notes

If you wanna play it on a network change the ip in the front from localhost to whatever ...
There are probably some bugs :)
